## Overview
In this project, our team developed Hemlock: A Poison Image Creator and Detector. Hemlock is an advanced system designed to apply and identify adversarial perturbations using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). We implemented an intuitive user interface that enables users to automatically generate poisoned images, thereby embedding protective signals into their visual content. In the current digital age, social media users face increasing threats of content theft and unauthorized use of their media in machine learning models. This tool offers an additional security layer by enabling content creators—particularly influencers and digital artists—to embed adversarial noise as a form of copyright protection. Our model serves as a proactive defense against content scraping, bot-generated impersonation, and deepfake misuse, while also supporting digital content ownership and traceability across platforms.
